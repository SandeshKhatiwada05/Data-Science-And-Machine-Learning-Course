What is Data Science?

Field that uses statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data.

Combines:

Math & Stats → for analysis

Programming (Python/R) → for automation & modeling

Business/domain understanding → for meaningful interpretation

Typical Workflow:

Data Collection

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building

Evaluation & Deployment

Common Python Libraries:

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn








Data Cleaning & Exploration

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values → dropna(), fillna()

Handle duplicates → drop_duplicates()

Fix data types → astype()

Handle outliers → IQR or Z-score methods

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand data patterns, correlations, and distributions.

Tools:

.describe() → summary stats

.info() → data structure

sns.heatmap(df.corr()) → correlation check

sns.pairplot(df) → feature relationships





Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

Feature Engineering:

Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

Example:

From “Date” → extract “Year”, “Month”, “Day”

Combine multiple columns → ratios, sums, or interactions

Data Preprocessing:

Encoding Categorical Data:

Label Encoding → LabelEncoder()

One-Hot Encoding → pd.get_dummies()

Scaling Features:

Standardization → StandardScaler()

Normalization → MinMaxScaler()

Train-Test Split:





Machine Learning Basics

Types of ML:

Supervised Learning → labeled data

Regression → predict continuous values

Classification → predict categories

Unsupervised Learning → no labels

Clustering → group similar data

Dimensionality Reduction → reduce features

Reinforcement Learning → agent learns via rewards

Common Algorithms:

Type	Algorithm	Example
Regression	Linear Regression	Predict house price
Classification	Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM	Spam detection
Clustering	K-Means	Customer segmentation
Dim. Reduction	PCA	Visualizatio
